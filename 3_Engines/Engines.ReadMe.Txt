Engines are functions that make no decisions, and carry no state. They take in parameters and return values. An engine should be passed in everything
it needs to perform the calculation it is being asked to perform.
- Engines can be accessed from Managers, and clients. 
- Engines can only access ResourceAccessors and Shared Projects. They CAN NOT access Managers or other Engines.
